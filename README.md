<a id="org5f7efbc"></a>

## Installation

1.  Config melpa source, please read: <http://melpa.org/#/getting-started>
2.  M-x package-install RET switch-window RET

Note: User can install switch-window with [El-Get](http://github.com/dimitri/el-get) too.


<a id="org3ffde0b"></a>

## Configure and Usage

    (require 'switch-window)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x o") 'switch-window)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 1") 'switch-window-then-maximize)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 2") 'switch-window-then-split-below)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 3") 'switch-window-then-split-right)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 0") 'switch-window-then-delete)

When switch-window is enabled, user can use the below five keys:

| key   | command description   |
|----- |--------------------- |
| "i"   | Move the border up    |
| "k"   | Move the border down  |
| "j"   | Move the border left  |
| "k"   | Move the border right |
| "b"   | Balance windows       |
| "SPC" | Resume auto-resize    |

If you want to customize this feature, please see variable: \`switch-window-extra-map'.

Note: if you use auto-resize window feature, you **must** know that when you execute above window operate commands, auto-resize feature will be disabled temporarily, you should use above "SPC" key to resume.

## Tips


<a id="orgd2afb6f"></a>

### I want to select a window with "a-z" instead of "1-9".

    (setq switch-window-shortcut-style 'qwerty)
    (setq switch-window-qwerty-shortcuts
          '("a" "s" "d" "f" "j" "k" "l" ";" "w" "e" "i" "o"))


<a id="org624329e"></a>

### I want to let window to show bigger label.

    (setq switch-window-increase 6) ;Increase or decrease this number.


<a id="org85d232e"></a>

### I want to **hide** window label when window's number < 3

    (setq switch-window-threshold 2)


<a id="orgd1f67bc"></a>

### I want to select minibuffer with label "z".

    (setq switch-window-minibuffer-shortcut ?z)


<a id="orgf94e516"></a>

### I want to auto resize a window when switch to it

    (setq switch-window-auto-resize-window t)
    (setq switch-window-default-window-size 0.8) ;80% of frame size
    (switch-window-mouse-auto-resize-window) ;auto resize when switch window with mouse

Advanced usage:

    (setq switch-window-auto-resize-window
          (lambda ()
            (equal (buffer-name) "*scratch*"))) ;when return t, run auto switch
    (setq switch-window-default-window-size '(0.8 . 0.6)) ;80% width and 60% height of frame

By the way, you can use package [golden-ratio](https://github.com/roman/golden-ratio.el) also.

### Switch-window seem to conflict with Exwm, how to do?

By default, switch-window get user's input with the help of function \`read-event', this approach does not work well with [Exwm](https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm) (Emacs X window manager), user should set the below variable and use minibuffer to get input instead:

    (setq switch-window-input-style 'minibuffer)

Note: if you use minibuffer to get input, the feature about \`switch-window-minibuffer-shortcut' will not work well.


<a id="orga172615"></a>

### I use text terminal, but I want **bigger** label.

The only choice is using asciiart, which **draw** a bigger label with **small** ascii char.

    (setq switch-window-shortcut-appearance 'asciiart)

<a id="org94136f2"></a>

### I want to use image or icon as label.

1.  Prepare your label images, rename them to: 1.png &#x2026; 9.png, a.png &#x2026; z.png.

    You can use other image types supported by emacs, please see: \`image-types'.
2.  Put all above images to directory: \`switch-window-image-directory'.
3.  Set variable: \`switch-window-shortcut-appearance'

        (setq switch-window-shortcut-appearance 'image)

![img](./snapshots/switch-window-2.png)


<a id="orgfe0bac8"></a>

### \`switch-window-shortcut-appearance' can't satisfy my need. how to do?

All you should do is hacking you own label buffer function, for example: my-switch-window-label-buffer-function, and set the below variable:

    (setq switch-window-label-buffer-function
          'my-switch-window-label-buffer-function)
