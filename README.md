## Tips


<a id="org62be9e3"></a>

### I want to select a window with "a-z" instead of "1-9".

    (setq switch-window-shortcut-style 'qwerty)
    (setq switch-window-qwerty-shortcuts
          '("a" "s" "d" "f" "j" "k" "l" ";" "w" "e" "i" "o"))


<a id="orgb5a7f25"></a>

### I want to let window to show bigger label.

    (setq switch-window-increase 6) ;Increase or decrease this number.


<a id="org9d5a106"></a>

### I want to **hide** window label when window's number < 3

    (setq switch-window-threshold 2)


<a id="org83e1ddb"></a>

### I want to select minibuffer with label "z".

    (setq switch-window-minibuffer-shortcut "z")


<a id="org49ae905"></a>

### I use text terminal, but I want **bigger** label.

The only choice is using asciiart, which **draw** a bigger label with **small** ascii char.

    (setq switch-window-asciiart-shortcut t)

### Switch-window seem to conflict with Exwm, how to do?

By default, switch-window get user's input with the help of function \`read-event', this approach does not work well with [Exwm](https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm) (Emacs X window manager), user should set the below variable and use minibuffer to get input instead:

    (setq switch-window-input-style 'minibuffer)


<a id="org1546442"></a>

### I want to make switch-window beautiful?

All you should to do is setting the variable \`switch-window-label-buffer-function', for example:

    (setq switch-window-label-buffer-function
          'my-switch-window-label-buffer-function)

The below are some switch-window user's showcases:
