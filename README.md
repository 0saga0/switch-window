<a id="org1c89b8d"></a>

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 1") 'switch-window-then-maximize)

<a id="org25d4be3"></a>

## Tips


<a id="org7393857"></a>

### I want to select a window with "a-z" instead of "1-9".

    (setq switch-window-shortcut-style 'qwerty)
    (setq switch-window-qwerty-shortcuts
          '("a" "s" "d" "f" "j" "k" "l" ";" "w" "e" "i" "o"))


<a id="org4c3ee94"></a>

### I want to let window to show bigger label.

    (setq switch-window-increase 6) ;Increase or decrease this number.


<a id="orgf74e66a"></a>

### I want to **hide** window label when window's number < 3

    (setq switch-window-threshold 2)


<a id="orga354f88"></a>

### I want to select minibuffer with label "z".

    (setq switch-window-minibuffer-shortcut "z")


<a id="org80dee4a"></a>

### Switch-window seem to conflict with Exwm, how to do?

By default, switch-window get user's input with the help of function \`read-event', this approach does not work well with [Exwm](https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm) (Emacs X window manager), user should set the below variable and use minibuffer to get input instead:

    (setq switch-window-input-style 'minibuffer)


<a id="org31494d3"></a>

### I use text terminal, but I want **bigger** label.

The only choice is using asciiart, which **draw** a bigger label with **small** ascii char.

    (setq switch-window-shortcut-appearance 'asciiart)

<a id="orge82fd4d"></a>

### I want to use image or icon as label.

1.  Prepare your label images, rename them to: 1.png &#x2026; 9.png, a.png &#x2026; z.png.

    You can use other image types supported by emacs, please see: \`image-types'.
2.  Put all above images to directory: \`switch-window-image-directory'.
3.  Set variable: \`switch-window-shortcut-appearance'

        (setq switch-window-shortcut-appearance 'image)

<a id="org7d280af"></a>

### \`switch-window-shortcut-appearance' can't satisfy my need. how to do?

All you should do is hacking you own label buffer function, for example: my-switch-window-label-buffer-function, and set the below variable:

    (setq switch-window-label-buffer-function
          'my-switch-window-label-buffer-function)
